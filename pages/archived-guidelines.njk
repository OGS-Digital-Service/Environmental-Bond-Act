<strong>Eligibility Guidelines for Climate Smart Communities Grant Program Projects Supported through the Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022 (Bond Act)</strong>

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) has developed the following eligibility guidelines to allocate funding under the Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022 (Bond Act) to support projects funded through New York State’s successful Climate Smart Communities (CSC) grant program. The CSC grant program is a competitive statewide grant program open to local governments to support the implementation of climate change mitigation and adaption projects. Bond Act funding may only be used for certain capital projects. Other activities eligible for CSC grants may be eligible for State Environmental Protection Funds (EPF). NYS DEC will use public input on these draft eligibility guidelines to inform development of the Bond Act-funded CSC grant program.

The CSC grant program makes awards of between $50,000 and $2 million each to support locally administered projects to adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions outside the power sector, as described below. Since the program's inception, NYS DEC has awarded more than $60 million from the EPF to municipalities in support of local climate mitigation and adaptation projects. Bond Act resources will augment ongoing EPF funding, with grant opportunities made available via the same request for applications.",

                <strong>Eligibility Guidelines for Projects to Expand the Existing Tree Canopy and Bolster Community Health</strong>

                The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) has developed the following eligibility guidelines to implement funding under the Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022 (Bond Act). To allocate funding under these proposed guidelines, NYS DEC will use the authority granted in provisions of the Bond Act to undertake State-administered projects. Additional eligibility guidelines being developed will include grant opportunities for locally administered initiatives.

                In order to achieve and advance climate change mitigation goals identified in the Bond Act, specifically those found in §58-0701, including carbon sequestration, urban forestry projects such as forest and habitat restoration, expansion of existing tree canopy, and bolstering community health, NYS DEC will use Bond Act funds to support the expansion of New York State’s existing tree canopy and urban forestry projects by:
                <ul>
                <li>building capacity for production of plant materials; and</li>
                <li>investing in the capital cost to procure and develop a comprehensive data tracking and management system to enable New York State to achieve and advance climate change mitigation goals identified in the Bond Act.</li>
                </ul>
                The Bond Act requires that disadvantaged communities shall receive no less than 35 percent, with the goal of 40 percent, of the benefit of total Bond Act funds ($4.2 billion). The term disadvantaged communities shall mean the same definition approved by the Climate Justice Working Group under the State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. In line with this goal, NYS DEC will aim to ensure at least 40 percent of each program benefits disadvantaged communities.

                The projects to Expand the Existing Tree Canopy and Bolster Community Health will facilitate implementation of future programs that will directly benefit disadvantaged communities and communities statewide.

                Eligible activities include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Projects to repair and/or update New York State’s capacity to produce seedlings and bare root trees through the upgrade and modernization of the New York State’s tree nursery and seed production facilities. The project aims to support: </li>
                    <li>Development and modernization of greenhouses using renewable energy to provide expanded seed processing and storage capabilities;</li>
                    <li>Improvements to seedling nursery infrastructure that increase seedling production capacity and survival; and</li>
                    <li>Development of a Forest and Ecosystem Health Lab facility to promote ecosystem health, enhance carbon sequestration, and support scientific research.</li>
                </ul>
                2. Capital investment in a database to track forest stand asset creation, tree planting, inventory, assessment, management and monitoring, and data dashboards reporting on acreage and type of land conserved. The database will help meet New York State’s 30 x 30 goal to conserve 30 percent of the state’s land and water by 2030 and mandates for modelling forest carbon sequestration and storage that contribute to achieving New York State’s climate goals.

                To align with the climate change mitigation goal outlined in the Bond Act, NYS DEC will initiate the development of a comprehensive reforestation database. This database will serve as a public-facing, spatially based platform designed to track all reforestation initiatives, monitor progress, and assess success. The primary objectives of this database are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhanced Collaboration: To encourage collaboration among stakeholders and partners by providing a platform for sharing information and coordinating efforts in support of landscape-wide reforestation goals and achievements; and</li>

                description:"Past Due Public Comment Deadline: April 14, 2023

                <strong>The New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation (NYS EFC) has developed the following eligibility guidelines to implement funding under the Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022 (Bond Act).</strong>

                These guidelines apply to financial assistance payments for municipal projects to reduce, avoid, or eliminate point and non-point source discharges to water as authorized by the New York State Water Improvement Infrastructure Act of 2017 and Public Authorities Law §1285-s (Intermunicipal Water Infrastructure Grant Program) pursuant to ECL § 58-0903(1)(e). Grant eligible critical water infrastructure projects include those that combat emerging contaminants such as PFOA, PFOS and 1,4 dioxane with system upgrades and innovative pilot technologies, along with those that address combined and/or sanitary sewer overflow impacts from extreme weather events, and those that combine green infrastructure and nature-based features to ensure climate resilient infrastructure.

                <strong>New York State Water Infrastructure Improvement Act (WIIA)</strong>

                Eligible projects include water quality infrastructure projects at municipally owned sewage treatment works or municipally owned public water systems for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Construction, replacement, or repair of infrastructure; and</li>
                    <li>Compliance with environmental and public health laws and regulations related to water quality and climate adaptation.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Each WIIA project must meet the following criteria:</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Result in construction for the requested scope;</li>
                    <li>Not have started construction before the October 1 preceding the funding application deadline;</li>
                    <li>Not have completed construction before the funding application deadline; and</li>
                    <li>Include the applicable NYS EFC terms and conditions in contracts under construction.</li>
                    </ul>
                <strong>New York State Intermunicipal Water Infrastructure Grant Program (IMG)</strong>

                Pursuant to the IMG, NYS EFC will provide grants for infrastructure projects to be undertaken by two or more cooperating municipalities for consolidation of infrastructure or services. IMG funding will be awarded for construction, replacement or repair of a drinking water or sewage treatment infrastructure project that serves multiple municipalities, such as shared water quality infrastructure that protects public health, the environment, or results in compliance with environmental and public health laws and regulations related to water quality and climate adaptation.

                <strong>Each IMG project must meet the following criteria:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve multiple municipalities;</li>
                    <li>Be a shared drinking water or sewage treatment infrastructure project, such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>More than one municipality undertaking a capital improvement project jointly,</li>
                        <li>Consolidation of intermunicipal facilities,</li>
                        <li>Shared water quality infrastructure,</li>
                        <li>Regional wastewater treatment facilities, or</li>
                        <li>The interconnection of multiple municipal water systems;</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Have a valid and binding project Intermunicipal Agreement (IMA) between at least two cooperating municipalities related to financing of the IMG project that describes the proposed project, the role of each municipality, and the costs attributable to each municipality;</li>
                    <li>Designate a lead municipality that applies on behalf of all cooperating municipalities;</li>
                    <li>Result in construction for the requested scope;</li>
